We would like to announce the first point release of the 0.13.x series. This
LibFM-Qt point release fixes a regression in
[Qt 5.11](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-67948), which will crash
[PcmanFM-Qt](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/issues/685]) under certain
conditions.

The release can be downloaded from
[downloads.lxqt.org](https://downloads.lxqt.org/downloads/libfm-qt/0.13.1/)
or [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/libfm-qt/releases/tag/0.13.1).
