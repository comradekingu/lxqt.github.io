The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of lxqt-session 0.16.0.
The release can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-session/releases).

Main changes:

 * The Default Applications page is removed from LXQt Session Settings because default applications are now handled by the File Associations dialog in a better way (also, the Default Terminal implementation was just wrong â€” the TERM environment variable is used to specify the terminal type, e.g. vt100).

A full list of changes is in the CHANGELOG file.
