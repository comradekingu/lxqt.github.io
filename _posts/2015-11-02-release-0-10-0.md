The LXQt 0.10.0 release is available!

This release, we focused on cleanup, polishing and quality-of-life
improvements, with over 400 issues fixed and dozens of new
translations. We have also gained two new frameworks: Solid, which
replaces liblxqt-mount and some custom power management code and
libkscreen, which replaces system xrandr calls and is wayland
forward-compatible.

Downloads and links are hosted on [downloads.lxqt.org](http://downloads.lxqt.org/lxqt/0.10.0/).
Issues and pull requests should be filed on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt).
Contributors should take a look at our
[Contributing Code](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/wiki/Contributing-code) document.

The full release announcement is available on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/p/lxde/mailman/message/34586993/).

Enjoy!
