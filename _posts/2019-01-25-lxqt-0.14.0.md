The LXQt team is proud to announce the release of LXQt 0.14.0, the Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment.

The LXQt team is working hard towards LXQt 1.0.0. [Want to help us?](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/Contributing-code) Found any bugs? Please file bug reports and pull requests on our [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/issues)!

The release can be downloaded at [downloads.lxqt.org](https://downloads.lxqt.org/current.html) or [Github](https://github.com/lxqt)

### Highlights

* Split view is added to pcmanfm-qt. pcmanfm-qt handles desktop and also mounts more efficiently by benefiting from the improvements in libfm-qt.
* Now, Desktop can have icons like Computer, Network, User-Dir and Trash, the Trash icon being interactive.
* Render image EXIF data and new upload target (ImgBB) for lximage-qt
* Custom terminal margins and history-based tab switching are added to qterminal.
* All packages received massive translation updates.


### Notes For Packagers

* Please follow the [build order](https://forum.lxqt.org/t/build-order-release-plan/292).
* We now depend on cmake_minimum_required 3.1.0 and lxqt-build-tools 0.6.0
* We now depend on C++ ISO Standard 14, removed support for < 14
* We moved all translations back to the repositories where they belong to - lxqt-l10n is deprecated and abandoned.
