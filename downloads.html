<p>Downloads are hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>Please go to <a href="https://github.com/lxqt">LXQt</a> GitHub organization and click on each individual component, then on releases. You can find all published releases there.
<p>For example: <a href="https://github.com/lxqt/libfm-qt/releases">lxqt/libfm-qt/releases</a> lists you all the releases for <code>libfm-qt</code>. You can download <code>libfm-qt-VERSION.tar.xz</code> and <code>libfm-qt-VERSION.tar.xz.asc</code> which you usually found on our website directly from there.</p>
