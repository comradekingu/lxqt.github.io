	LXQt is a lightweight Desktop Environment. It is the product of the merge between the
	LXDE-Qt and the Razor-qt projects: A lightweight, modular, blazing-fast and
	user-friendly desktop environment.

<p>
	LXQt will not replace <a href="http://lxde.org">LXDE</a>. They are both active and maintained projects.
	See the <a href="https://github.com/lxde/lxqt/wiki/History">history</a> section in our
	wiki to learn more about the relation between these two desktop environments.
